<h1> Voyant Text Analysis- Dracula by Bram Stoker </h1>
  <p>There have been many TV dramas and movies that are motivated by a theme of "fear" or "horror", and one of the most popular examples these days is a TV drama series, titled, The Walking Dead. Personally, it is creepy and a little bit disgusting, but I saw many episodes with excitement and fear. The fear in The Walking Dead is a little different from other horror dramas and movies, for which I call "a fear of exclusion." When people are bitten by "the Walkers" in The Walking Dead, there is no way to be cured, and there is no way to prevent themselves from being a zombie. This kind of fear is in the center of this drama, which creates the most fearful feeing of being outsiders. Once infected, they are not going to be a member of the community any more, then they should be excluded. 
  </p>
<li><p>The most vivid example in literature concerning this fear is Dracula by Bram Stoker. Once you are bitten by a vampire, then you will lose your identity as a member of the society, community, and even your family. 
 </p></li>
   <li><p>
Then I was little curious what kind of meaningful data can be made from the text, Dracula, by the text analysis tool, Voyant. Before I execute the program, I made a premise: there should be some vocabulary bearing the fear that I have aforementioned, in the vicinity of the word, "blood", because, in the novel, the blood is the vehicle of infection.

<p> The outcome of the text analysis is exactly what I expected. There are many words and expressions, near the word, blood, abiding the fearful sentiment of being transmitted: 'poison', 'filthy', 'transfusion',' corruption', 'dirty water', 'shame', 'pollution', 'assimilation', 'illness', 'unclean', 'destroy',' stained', 'change.' Other sets of vocabulary concerning this fear are: 'spirit', 'sacred', 'soul', 'baptism', 'origin', on the one hand, 'gorge', 'repletion', 'satiate', 'lust', 'trance', 'delirium', 'raving' on the other hand. And one another look that I could easily distinguish from this data is a binary opposition of some vocabulary. Vampires and human beings are a totally different existence. There is no middle position between them, and there is no compromise with infection.

<p>In this set of vocabulary, I omitted some common verbs such as said, shall, came, went, got, knew, and so on, because those verbs are not only irrelevant to what I am interested in, but also they are the common usages in this kind of narrative such as a novel. The first observation in this set of vocabulary is the most frequent noun, 'time', which is very obvious as the narrative develops on the basis of time to which the Count Dracula is highly subjected. Then, there are some sets of opposite words: good(257)and poor(193), night(257) and day(220), and life(148) and dead(110). One important aspect of these sets of vocabulary is the frequency of appearance and the pattern.

  <p>For example, a set of opposite words, 'night' and 'day',  partly shows that the narrative is composed based on this binary opposite time periods: at night, something happens, at day, looking for meaning of what happens; 'life' and 'death' appear in this novel at a similar frequency and pattern, which reminds us to think of the fearful change; 'dog' and 'wolf', which represent the Count Dracula in a form of disguise and truth of him. In the end, these examples of binary opposition help to develop the theme of fear as a whole. "Are you bitten? Then it's over, you are something else." It is a black or white!  
  </p>
  <li><p>
In conclusion, I was a little skeptical about the text analysis using a tool, such as Voyant, in the first place because it does not concern about any rhetoric, the relation between cause and effect, tone and mood, and the like. However, it may help readers to extend a certain idea of a literary work, using the features of, for example, word frequency and vicinity. Although, Voyant did not suggest a keen analysis on the text of Dracula, it certainly gave me an opportunity to contemplate about a certain word or words to extend my thoughts.
