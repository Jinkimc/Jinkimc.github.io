<h1> Voyant Text Analysis- Dracula by Bram Stoker </h1>
  <p style="font-size:300%;">There</p> <p>have been many TV dramas and movies that are motivated by a theme of "fear" or "horror"; one of the most popular examples these days is a TV drama series, The Walking Dead. Personally, it is creepy and a little bit disgusting, but I saw many episodes with excitement and fear. The fear in The Walking Dead is a little different from other horror dramas and movies, for which I call "a fear of exclusion." When people are bitten by "the Walkers" in The Walking Dead, there is no way to be cured, and there is no way to prevent themselves from being a zombie. This kind of fear is in the center of this drama, which creates the most fearful feeing of being outsiders. Once infected, they are not going to be a member of the community any more, then excluded. 
The most vivid example in literature concerning this fear is Dracula by Bram Stoker. Once you are bitten by a vampire, then you will lose your identity as a member of the society, community, and even your family. 
Then I was little curious what kind of meaningful data can be made from the text, Dracula, by the text analysis tool, Voyant. Before I execute the program, I made a premise: there should be some vocabulary bearing the fear, aforementioned, in the vicinity of a word, "blood", because, in the novel, the blood is the vehicle of infection.
